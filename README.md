# KingOfTheMatrix
This is a fun little Graph Theory example.  Given a binary nxm matrix, the task here is to find the largest set of connected (adjacent) entries with a '1'. In this example I convert the matrix into a graph and use a depth first search algorithm to find the largest connected component.
